Reverse Proxy using Apache enabling Letsencrypt SSL with certbot webroot

For my home network, I have only one IP address and therefore one port 80/443 for all of my home web services.  This repository documents how I setup an Apache reverse proxy to route port 80/443 traffic to the various different services I support.  This includes a blogs, storage, media and websites.  Some running on standalone servers, others running in a kubernetes cluster.

The reverse proxy needs to do the following steps:
- Define a virtual host per application and redirect it to the internal server and port number
- Redirect www to non-www (www.example.com -> example.com)
- Map http requests to https
- Use certbot to get and renew certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

I have an existing Apache httpd server -- I am adding the reverse proxy function to it as a series of proxy.appname.conf files. The way reverse proxys work, I cannot redirect an https requests.  I must terminate the SSL at the reverse proxy and forward the traffic to it on port 80.

# Apache-based Reverse Proxy Virtual Hosts
THe reverse proxy is listening on port 80 and 443, getting traffic from my cable-modem/home router.  Apache httpd takes the incoming packets and maps them to virtual hosts, in this case, based on host name.  The [ProxyPass directive ](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass) invokes a reverse proxy function and redirects the traffic. Here's a very simple example for my weather web page http://napervilleweather.com.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
 ServerName napervilleweather.com
 ServerAlias www.napervilleweather.com
 ProxyPreserveHost On
 ProxyPass / http://192.168.100.174:30140/
 ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.100.174:30140/
</VirtualHost>
```
In this particular case, the ProxyPass/ProxyPassReverse directives are forwarding the traffic to my kubernetes cluster.  

I need to make a virtual host configuration for each of my many services.  I am just showing one example.

# Redirect www to non-www
I have decided that I want to force all services to redirect to a URL without the www prefix.  That is www.napervilleweather.com -> napervilleweather.com.
Apache httpd [rewrite engine](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/intro.html) can do this. [See example.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-redirect-www-to-non-www-with-apache-on-centos-7).  Here's how the virtual host configuration file changes
```
...
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.napervilleweather.com
 ReWriteRule ^ http://napervilleweather.com%{REQUEST_URI} [END,QSA,R=permanent]
 ...
 ```
 I am pretty sure the rewrite rules get run before the ProxyPass ones.
