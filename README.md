Reverse Proxy using Apache enabling Letsencrypt SSL with certbot webroot

For my home network, I have only one IP address and therefore one port 80/443 for all of my home web services.  This repository documents how I setup an Apache reverse proxy to route port 80/443 traffic to the various different services I support.  This includes a blogs, storage, media and websites.  Some running on standalone servers, others running in a kubernetes cluster.

The reverse proxy needs to do the following steps:
- Define a virtual host per application and redirect it to the internal server and port number
- Redirect www to non-www (www.example.com -> example.com)
- Map http requests to https
- Use certbot to get and renew certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

I have an existing Apache httpd server -- I am adding the reverse proxy function to it as a series of proxy.appname.conf files.
